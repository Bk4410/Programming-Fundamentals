    <p>(English Homework) My art piece is of Holden and Ackley talking. 
       In the drawing they are in Holden’s room. 
       Ackley walked in while Holden was reading a book and then went around examining everything. 
       I was inspired to draw them in this spot because you don’t get many details so it's a drawing that can give the reader something to go off of. 
       I also did this scene since I ended my writing in the middle of it, and I left it to be continued. 
       I made it by putting the whole scene mushed together, meaning things are happening at the same time where in what I wrote they happened at separate times.</p>
    <p>Part of this sentence is in <b>bold. </b>
       And a part of this sentence is<u>underlined.</u></p>
